# IRIS-machine-learning

I  have used the Iris dataset available on https://www.kaggle.com/ .
I have used python for this project.
This  is the most easy  machine learning project for the beginners . 
Basic knowledge of supervised learning and classification problems is sufficient to understand the project 
We have used the support vector machines for the predictions .
Most of the libraries used are available at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html . 
HOW WE HAVE APPROACHED THE PROBLEM :
 We have been given with 4 coloums : namely SepalLength , SepalWidth , PetalLength , PetalWidth and Specied 
 We were supposed to classify any arbitry iris based on it's features . 
 So we plotted scatter plots for various species to check which features give us most distinct classification 
 we found that the PetalLength vs PetalWidtthCm gave us a clear picture to classify various iris species . 
 So we used the sklearn libraries for training testing and splitting data. 
 We used sklearn libraries for the support vector machines algorithm and accuracy_score
